                I live in India and am currently in 11th grade. My main focus is on JavaScript, and I am dedicated to creating innovative and user-friendly solutions for clients and communities. I am also involved in a bakery project, which I enjoy as it allows me to connect with diverse individuals. Additionally, I am passionate about nature and enjoy researching various plants and their features.
